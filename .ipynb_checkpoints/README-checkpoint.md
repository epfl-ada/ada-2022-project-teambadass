# The recipe for a movie success 
## Abstract
The global film industry is a [`$`100 billion worth industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry). There is a vast potential to earn money, and the producers are willing to sacrifice considerable costs to become a movie success. Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, the most expensive film, cost [`$`379 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films). With such an amount at your disposal, you may wonder what you should spend the money on. Should you use them to get one of the biggest movie stars in your cast? For many, this may be tempting. One of the most famous actors, Tom Cruise, was rewarded [`$`100,000,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-paid_film_actors) for his performance in Top Gun: Maverick. But was it worth it? Or could the money be better spent? The CMU Movie Summary Corpus contains data on the revenue of  8 401 movies. We will analyze this data to create a recipe for how to make a successful movie.
