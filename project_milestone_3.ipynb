    "This notebook intends to explore and describe the relevant aspects of our data sets, preprocess it, and perform some initial analysis. The first part of the notebook contains the loading of data and some general preprocessing used throughout the notebook. The rest of the notebook is divided into the five research questions specified in [**README**](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2022-project-teambadass/blob/main/README.md). Each section contains specific preprocessing for the task and necessary statistics and plots. The initial analysis we have performed intends to give us a clue whether our choice of methods is reasonable and sound. "

    "\n",
    " **Problem:**\n",
    "1. We observe that many movies only have a few actors. It´s unlikely that a movie only has one actor, which is the case for ~50 movies in the dataset. The reason is probably that the dataset initially focused on characters, which can be more difficult to extract than actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We observe that movies with more actors have higher revenue. This is something to be aware of since more actors will likely provide more diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "1. A possible solution would be to collect data about the number of actors from a different dataset. The problem with an external dataset will be finding data about ethnicity and gender. This was not included in the [IMDb datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It will be necessary to look at the number of ethnicities and females with the total number of actors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "1. Setting a threshold for the number of actors is a good solution that still enables us to use the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Computing an `ethnicity_score` and `fraction_of_female` to also consider the total number of actors."

    "- We observe a significant correlation between `num_ethnicities` and `movie_box_office_revenue.`\n",
    "- Further, we observe that the correlation between `num_actors` and `movie_box_office_revenue` is reduced after we filtered out movies with less than ten actors. This indicates that the number of actors has the most significant impact when there are few actors, e.g., increasing from 5 to 6 will have a more substantial effect on the revenue than rising from 14 to 15.\n",
    "- It is still difficult to interpret how big impact `num_ethnicities` and `num_actors` have on `movie_box_office_revenue` separately since they are highly correlated.\n",
    "- To try to isolate the impact ethnicities have on the revenue, we will instead look at an ethnicity_score, which is calculated as follow: $ethnicity\\: score = \\frac{number\\,of\\,ethnicities}{number\\,of\\,actors}$"

    "We cannot be sure whether Alan Rickman aka Professor Severus Snape has the highest effect on box office revenue. However, Alan Rickman has performed  in several movies with extremely high box office revenue, so the result is an indication that our choice of method could be further explored to gain insight into what actors affect box office revenue the most. The most urgent improvement of the model is to include more predictors (both categorical and continous) to avoid confounders."

    "- We also see that movie with runtime between 80-120 minutes have similar distribution of revenue and movies with runtime less than 80 minutes generate less revenue (highet revenue is below $400000000). - Thus we can raise the question that if 80 minute could be a threshold for movie's revenue performance and we will address it in the next section."

    "- From the scatterplot, we see that there is a negative linear relationship between positive word proportion and revenue. In contrast, there is a positive linear relationship between negative word proportion and revenue. There is also a positive linear relationship between violent word proportion and revenue. \n",
    "- However from previous regression analysis, the R squared value (0.004 - positive, 0.000 - negative, 0.008 - violent) is too small to justify the dependency between all sentiments and revenue. \n",
    "- We see a opposing relationship between positive and negative plots and we will discover if more positive plot or more negative plot can boost the revenue in the following section."
